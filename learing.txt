Redux=>

what is redux?
redux is the database of frontend . it stores the state and fetch to another page . it is helpful in very complex application.

to create redux folder , create a redux folder insider src of frontend, then inside redux folder make actions and reducers folder.
actions forder is to call all apis. and reducers creates the actions or what to do with the data 

Download redux dev tool extension and npm i redux-devtool-extension

then we have to connect redux to the application,
to connect that we have to  create file called state.js inside the redux folder 
the import 


we need a middleware 
for that npm i thunk


all steps
npm i redux react-redux redux-devtools-extension redux-thunk


make changess in store.js

import {createStore,combineReducers, applyMiddleware} from 'redux';

import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

import {composeWithDevTools} from 'redux-devtools-extension'


const reducer = combineReducers({
    todo:todoReducers
})

const middleware = [thunk];

const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(...middleware))

)

export default store;

make changes in index.js of main app

import store from './Redux/store';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

root.render(
  <Provider store={store}>

  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
  </Provider>













  to connect backend to frontend we use cors 
  npm install cors
